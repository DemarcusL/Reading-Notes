  <Body> Markdown is a great way to the look of the code within gethub. What is Markdown?
  Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *. Headers

  `# This is an <h1> tag`
  `## This is an <h2> tag`
  `###### This is an <h6> tag`

  Emphasis

  `*This text will be italic*`
  `_This will also be italic_`

  `**This text will be bold**`
  `__This will also be bold__`

  `_You **can** combine them_`


  How to choose a text editor. What is a text editor?
  A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
  your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
  allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
  to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
  important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
  the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
  highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
  fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
  extensions available when you need them.
