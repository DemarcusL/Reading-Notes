I see growth mindset as I can improve in anything I can do and work at.
I can increase my skills by DOING THE WORK, only failing on that do I fail myself. Growth mindset is also a way to not exchange , but to foster a way to LEARN and develope on what I already know. My notes also reflect this cause I listed on paper Mindset is everything, you can foster a learning with doing the work differently. Try something new rather than sit and wait.
