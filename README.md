<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Hello, this is Deamrcus L and This is where I will take notes !</h2>
<h3>  
I see grwoth mindset as I can improve in anything I can do and work at.
I can increase my skills by DOING THE WORK, only failing on that do I fail myself.
Growth mindset is also a way to not exchange, but to foster a way to LEARN and develope on what I already know.
