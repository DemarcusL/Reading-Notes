<h3>
I see growth mindset as I can improve in anything I can do and work at.
<Br>

 I can increase my skills by *DOING THE WORK*, only failing on that do I **fail** myself.
Growth mindset is also a way to not ~~exchange~~ , ***but to foster a way to LEARN and develope on what I already know***.
My notes also reflect this cause I listed on paper Mindset is everything, you can foster a learning with doing the work differently. Try something new rather than sit and wait.
  
<Br> 
I will keep learning new things even if u cant understand the topic like I  do now. I will ask for others methods and inputs to see things in a new way. I will keep growing!
