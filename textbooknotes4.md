## Images ##

Upon completeing your html doc. You can go into CSS and help make your page look proessional.

To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

## src ##

This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder
called images — relative URLs were covered on pages 83-84).

## alt ##

This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

## title ##

You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information
about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the
user hovers over the image.

A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.

As a website grows, keeping images in a separate folder helps you understand how the site is organized. Here you can see an example of the files for a website; all of the images are
stored in a folder called images.

On a big site you might like to add subfolders inside the images folder. For example, images such as logos and buttons might sit in a folder called interface, product photographs might sit in a page
called products, and images related to news might live in a folder called news.

Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement
that produce different results:
1: before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new
line after the image.
2: inside the start of a
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with
the bottom of the image.
3: in the middle of a
paragraph
The image is placed between the
words of the paragraph that it
appears in.

## Colors ##

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.

### Text ###

The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
● Those that directly affect the font and its appearance
(including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic,
and the size of the text)
● Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
what font you were using (including the color of text and
the spacing between words and letters)

When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.

Different browsers support different formats for fonts (in the same way that they support different audio and video formats), so you will need to supply the font in several variations to reach all browsers.
