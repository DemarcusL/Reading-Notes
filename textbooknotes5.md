What is the hardest thing about writing code?

There are many common answers to this question:

Learning a new technology
Naming things
Testing your code
Debugging
Fixing bugs
Making software maintainable
The list goes on and on.
But as I reflect back on my programming career, and I’ve conversed with many new programmers that are learning the craft, I’ve found the single hardest thing about programming is learning the problem domain.

I am often asked why I keep demonstrating how to build the same simple application over and over again in each of my courses.
The answer is “familiarity.”

Why problem domains are hard

The big issue is that many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.
The real world is a messy place.  Many of the problem domains we face as programmers are difficult to understand and look completely different depending on your viewpoint.

As programmers, we also are often not given complete information about the problem domain, so we don’t even have the information we need to understand it.

Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain
