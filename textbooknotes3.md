# Links and Layout #

## Links are the defining feature of the web ##

because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a> = what I use the most.

<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">
Internet Movie Database</a> (opens in new window) = used to open another window

## Building Blocks ##

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
borders, margins, padding, and background colors. 

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
It is common to group a number of elements together inside a <div>
(or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together
all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and
the main navigation). The <div> element that contains this group of
elements is then referred to as the containing element

To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed.

The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.
Anything else that sits inside
the containing element will
flow around the element that is
floated. = you did this for your website in 102 !
