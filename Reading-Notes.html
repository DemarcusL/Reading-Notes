    Markdown is a great way to the look of the code within gethub. What is Markdown?
    Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or
    italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is
    just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *. Headers

    This is an < h1> tag

      This is an < h2> tag

        This is an < h6> tag

          Emphasis

          *This text will be italic*
          _This will also be italic_

          **This text will be bold**
          __This will also be bold__

          You **can** combine them_`
